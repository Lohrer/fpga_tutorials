\section{Creating an Example Project}
\label{sec:example_project}

This section will take you through how to set up a project, create a simple design, run a
simulation, create a top-level design, synthesize and implement your design, and finally
program the FPGA.

Open Vivado, and select File$\rightarrow$New Project or click on Create New Project in the
quick start screen.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]

        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {1} (end);

        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {2} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.675,0.5) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {3} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}

    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{new_project_type}

        %\draw[help lines,xstep=.1,ystep=.1] (0,0) grid (1,1);
        \node (start) at (0.672,0.3) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Make sure the "Target language" is set to VHDL.
Then create two source files, gates2 and gates2\_tb.
You can skip adding any files during project creation in the future, but for now to show how
this is done we will do it here.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{new_project_add_sources}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.42,0.23) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {1} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.85,0.495) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {2} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}

    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{create_gates2}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{create_gates2_tb}
    \end{minipage}
\end{center}

After creating gates2\_tb, set it to simulation only.
We will create a testbench with this file which only gets used in simulation.
Now you should have the following showing:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{new_project_sources_added}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.8,0.555) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {1} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.675,0.32) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {2} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Now find the proper Xilinx Design Constraints (XDC) file for your board.
For Dr. Hanna or Dr. Gorski's class you should use one provided on Moodle which offer
preconfigured names for outputs matching the book's examples.
For Dr. LLamocca's class you should use the master XDC file provided by Digilent Inc.
He has made it available on Moodle as well.
Make sure you use the correct XDC file for your board, and note that the Nexys 4 and Nexys 4 DDR
are two different boards.

Check "Copy constraints files into project" to copy the .xdc file into the project folder.
Otherwise, the .xdc file will be linked to and if you ever move or delete it your project
will no longer work.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{new_project_add_constraints}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.61,0.393) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {1} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.45,0.286) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {2} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.676,0.42) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {3} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

On the next screen you pick the FPGA that we are targeting, in the case of the Nexys 4 or
Nexys 4 DDR board it is an Artix 7 with part number xc7a100tcsg324-1.
The Basys 3 has an Artix 7 FPGA with part number xc7a35tcpg236-1.
You can use the filter categories and search box to limit the selection to the desired part number.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{new_project_part}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.61,0.393) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {1} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.676,0.3) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {2} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

To finish the project creation step make sure the summary looks correct and then press Finish.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{new_project_summary}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.8,0.35) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Since you listed two files to create, after creating the project a window will pop-up asking to
define the inputs and outputs of the two files.
They should be exactly as shown below, gates2\_tb has no inputs or outputs, and gates2 has a and b
as inputs and a 6-bit bus z[5:0] as an output.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{define_modules_gates2}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{define_modules_gates2_tb}
\end{center}

\subsection{First Component}

Once you are done creating the project and module definitions, you should see the following
screen, other than some extra sections that are minimized so that the screenshots fit in this
document easier.
On the left is your sources list, which have all your project files listed.
If you click on gates2, it will open it in the right section and you will see the auto-generated
code skeleton.
You should see your a, b, and z signals you created earlier as inputs and outputs to the module.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{project_gates2}
\end{center}

Edit the file so that is looks like the following picture.
Alternatively, easy to copy code is given below.
Note that all the auto-generated comments were removed, feel free to leave or remove them as
you wish, or even add your own comments! It is a good idea to add your name and date at the top
of the file in a comment.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL]
z(5) <= a and b;
z(4) <= a nand b;
z(3) <= a or b;
z(2) <= a nor b;
z(1) <= a xor b;
z(0) <= a xnor b;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{mdframed}[style=note]
    VHDL is case-insensitive. Capital letters don't matter.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{project_gates2_modified}
\end{center}

\subsection{Simulation}

Vivado seems to sometimes have a bug when creating simulation-only sources like our gates2\_tb.
It sometimes creates a blank file under the simulation directory and also a skeleton VHDL file
under the source directory.
The picture below on the left shows the project directory structure and the two gates2\_tb.vhd
files that were created.
To fix this bug after creating a simulation-only source, either move the file under the
source directory (which has the skeleton code) to replace the one in the simulation directory
(which is blank).
Alternatively simply delete the one in the source directory, but then you will be starting out
with a completely blank testbench file.
When done the project directory should look like the picture below on the right.

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{testbench_sources_bug}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{testbench_sources_bug_fixed}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{1mm}

Back in Vivado, since the testbench file, gates2\_tb was created as simulation-only,
it will show up under the simulation sources section.
Click on it to open it and modify it to have the following code.

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity gates2_tb is
end gates2_tb;

architecture behavioral of gates2_tb is
    component gates2
    port( a : in  std_logic;
          b : in  std_logic;
          z : out std_logic_vector(5 downto 0)
        );
    end component;
    -- Inputs
    signal a : std_logic := '0';
    signal b : std_logic := '0';
    -- Outputs
    signal z : std_logic_vector(5 downto 0);
begin
    -- Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
    uut: gates2 port map (
            a => a,
            b => b,
            z => z
        );
    -- Stimulus process
    stim_proc: process
    begin
        a <= '0';
        b <= '0';
        wait for 20 ns;

        a <= '0';
        b <= '1';
        wait for 20 ns;

        a <= '1';
        b <= '0';
        wait for 20 ns;

        a <= '1';
        b <= '1';
        wait for 20 ns;

        wait;
    end process;
end behavioral;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\strut

Once you are done run a behavioral simulation by clicking on Run Simulation and then Run
Behavioral simulation in the Flow Navigator to the left.
Make sure to save your files after you are done editing them, Vivado does not save files
automatically before running the simulation.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics{project_flow_simulation}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.83,0.1) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

When the simulation runs, you will want to press zoom-fit so that you can see the entire
simulation.
However, by default the simulation runs for 1 μs which happened to be longer than needed in
this case.
All the action happened in the first 100 ns!

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{simulation_zoom_fit}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.32,0.81) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Zoom in to the first 100 ns by clicking the zoom in button and dragging the scrollbar.
Alternatively, you can click and hold the mouse to zoom in, out, fit, or to a range.
When you zoom in, it zooms at the location of the cursor.
You can click on the waveform to put the cursor at that location.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{simulation_zoomed}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.24,0.81) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

You can see from time 0-20 ns that the inputs a and b are both 0, so the output should be 0x15.
You can check the truth tables of all the gates to see that this is correct.
Then the rest of the truth table is simulated in the simulation.
If your simulation doesn't look correct, go back and check your code to make sure it is correct.

Next is programming our board but first we have to make sure the inputs and outputs are properly
connected to the pins on our FPGA.
We do this by mapping our top-level signal names to pins in a constraints file.
If you are in Dr. Hanna or Dr. Gorski's class you should continue with the
\nameref{sec:toplevel} section.
If you are in Dr. Llamocca's class you should skip to the \nameref{sec:constraints} section.

\subsection{Top-Level Wrapper}
\label{sec:toplevel}
This section is aimed towards the style of Dr. Hanna or Dr. Gorski.
You can choose to use this method or skip to \nameref{sec:constraints}.
One option is to always use the same constraints file, and make sure that our top-level uses
the correct signal names.
Since we used a, b, and z for signal names in gates2, we will create a wrapper file called
gates2\_top that maps a to sw(1), b to sw(0), and z to ld.

First click on PROJECT MANAGER to get back to the project manager view of Vivado.
Either select File$\rightarrow$Add Sources... or click Add Sources under PROJECT MANAGER to
open up the Add Sources wizard. Make sure to select design sources.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{add_sources_type}
\end{center}

Just like creating gates2 and gates2\_tb click Create File and then type gates2\_top.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{add_sources_gates2_top}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.89,0.46) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {1} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.786,0.35) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {2} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[arrow/.style={-latex, line width=10pt, darkred!70}]
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0)
    {
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{define_modules_gates2_top}
    };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \node (start) at (0.65,0.202) {};
        \node [left of=start, xshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {1} (end);

        \node (start) at (0.736,0.3) {};
        \node [below of=start, yshift=-1.2cm] (end) {};
        \draw [arrow] (start) -- node [midway, black] {2} (end);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Just like in the testbench, in the top-level we are going to port-map in the gates2 component.
We will simply wire up the I/O of gates2 to the switches and LEDs.
Type in the following code so that your gates2\_top looks like the following picture.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity gates2_top is
    port ( sw : in  std_logic_vector(1 downto 0);
           ld : out std_logic_vector(5 downto 0));
end gates2_top;

architecture behavioral of gates2_top is
    component gates2
    port( a : in  std_logic;
          b : in  std_logic;
          z : out std_logic_vector(5 downto 0)
        );
    end component;
begin
    G2: gates2 port map (
            a => sw(1),
            b => sw(0),
            z => ld
        );
end behavioral;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsection{Editing Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
This section is aimed towards the style of Dr. Llamocca, if you created a top-level in the
previous section then skip to \nameref{sec:programming}.
You can choose to use this method or the previous \nameref{sec:toplevel} method.
Here instead of creating a wrapper file the constraints file is edited directly.
Since we used a, b, and z for signal names in gates2, we will modify the constraints file to
map a to SW1, b to SW0 and z to LED[5:0].

Open the constraints file we added when creating the project.
A \verb|#| is the comment symbol in .xdc files, so first uncomment the set\_property lines
for SW[0], SW[1], and LED[0]-LED[5].
Breaking down the first set\_property command below, "PACKAGE\_PIN J15" means connect to pin
J15, "IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33" means set the voltage level to 3.3V, and "get\_ports { a }" means
this property applies to the a signal of the top-level.
The second line shows z[0] which means it applies to the least-significant bit of the z signal of
the top-level.

\begin{verbatim}
set_property -dict { PACKAGE_PIN J15   IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 } [get_ports { a }];
set_property -dict { PACKAGE_PIN H17   IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 } [get_ports { z[0] }];
\end{verbatim}

\begin{mdframed}[style=note]
    While VHDL is case-insensitive, XDC files are not.
    Be careful that the case of the signal name in the top-level matches the case in the XDC file.
\end{mdframed}
