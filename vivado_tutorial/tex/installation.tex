FPGAs, such as the one on the Nexys 4 board.

{web installer}.
This is a direct link to the Windows installer file, although you will have to sign in.
If you are on another OS or want to use the single-file download, the latest versions of Xilinx
software are available at \url{https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html}.
During installation several gigabytes of files are downloaded so if you have a slow internet
connection it may be a good idea to install it at OU.
