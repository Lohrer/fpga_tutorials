This guide will show you how to install the required software and get an example design up and
running on the Nexys A7/DDR board.
If you are working on a lab computer, you can skip ahead to the section
\nameref{sec:example_project}.
If you are planning on using your own computer, the software is freely available but will take some
time to download and install.
Windows 7 and 10 are supported by the software.
Various Linux distributions are also supported by Vivado and the instructions for creating a
project should be similar for the Linux version.

In addition to the computers in our lab space, it is also possible to remotely connect to a Windows
server with Vivado installed. For instructions on how to connect see
